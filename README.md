# archlinux-installer
if this is the first time you've installed archlinux, the documentation can be difficult to read; that's why I made a small command file with the commands to be performed and their description to install ArchLinux with a desktop environment on an EFI system. 

You must have an ethernet connection to follow these steps.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any problems!
